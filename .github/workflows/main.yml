# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # Running linting using detekt,ktlint
  lint:
    name: Running lints
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Set up JDK 1.8
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: 1.8

      - name: Running Ktlint
        run: bash ./gradlew ktlint --stacktrace

      - name: Running detekt
        run: bash ./gradlew detekt --stacktrace
  
  
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    needs: lint
    name: Build app
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # build
      - name: Build the app
        run: ./gradlew build
